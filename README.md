## ‚ú® Key Features

This project is more than a static page; it's a showcase of modern frontend techniques.

-   **Interactive Particle Canvas:** A JavaScript-powered background of particles that dynamically react to mouse movement, covering the full scrollable height of the document.
-   **Premium Glassmorphic UI:** Extensive use of the `backdrop-filter` property to create a stunning "frosted glass" effect on all primary containers and modals.
-   **Fully Responsive Design:** The entire layout, from the main cards to the payment modals and even the site logo, is fluid and adapts perfectly to all screen sizes using modern CSS like `clamp()`.
-   **Multi-Option Payment Modals:** Separate, elegantly designed modals for both local (Pakistani) and global supporters, providing clear payment details.
-   **One-Click Clipboard Functionality:** "Copy" buttons next to every piece of payment information utilize the browser's Clipboard API for a seamless user experience.
-   **Dynamic Hover & Focus Effects:** Engaging micro-interactions on all interactive elements, including social links, payment cards, and buttons, to provide satisfying visual feedback.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack & Architectural Highlights

The project was built from the ground up using only core web technologies, with a focus on high-performance, object-oriented code and modern styling principles.

### Core Technologies
-   **HTML5:** Semantic markup for a well-structured and accessible content foundation.
-   **CSS3:** Advanced styling techniques including `clamp()` for fluid typography/sizing, `Flexbox`, `Grid`, custom properties, and pseudo-elements for intricate designs.
-   **JavaScript (ES6+):** Object-oriented programming (OOP) principles with classes (`CanvasManager`, `GridParticle`) to manage the complex animation engine and UI interactivity in a clean, modular, and performant way.

### Architectural Highlights
-   **Re-engineered Canvas Manager:** The background canvas is specifically engineered to use `document.body.scrollHeight` instead of `window.innerHeight`, solving the common problem of animated backgrounds not covering the entire page on scroll.
-   **Scroll-Aware Event Manager:** Mouse coordinates are calculated using `event.clientX + window.scrollX`, ensuring particle interactions are perfectly mapped regardless of the user's scroll position.
-   **Self-Contained Modules:** The JavaScript is organized into distinct, independent systems for the canvas, modals, and clipboard, which are initialized and linked at runtime for maximum code clarity and maintainability.
